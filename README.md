## üöÄ About The Project

IdentaMark is a toolkit designed for research and implementation of digital watermarking. This application provides comprehensive functionality for the watermark lifecycle, from embedding, attacking, to extracting.

This project is ideal for academic studies or the development of systems that require copyright protection or data authentication through watermarking.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Watermark Embedding:** Embed watermarks into image and audio files.
* **Watermark Attacks:** Test watermark robustness against various attacks, such as compression, cropping, or noise.
* **Watermark Extraction:** Extract embedded watermarks from media files.
* **Multi-format Support:** Compatible with common image and audio file formats.

## üõ†Ô∏è Watermarking Methods

IdentaMark stands out with its implementation of two different error-correcting codes to enhance watermark robustness:

* **BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) Codes:** A highly effective block coding method for detecting and correcting errors that occur during the watermarking process or attacks.
* **Convolutional Codes:** A coding method that produces a longer string from the input, providing better resilience against noise and distortion.
